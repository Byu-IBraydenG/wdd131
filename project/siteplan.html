        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>Site Name:</strong> My Favorite Temples</p>
        <p><strong>Reason for Selection:</strong> The reason I chose this topic for my website is because I wanted to

    <section id="site-purpose">
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to show my opinion on what temples are my personal favorite. It's to also bring a
            knowldge about certain temples to people who don't know about them.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="scenarios">
        <h2>scenarios</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Will the website work the way it was intended? The temple pictures show
            accordingly, inforamtion aligns correctly with each temple picture, the hotbar works as intended.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Will the colors match well? I'm going to test certain colors out to see if a
            match fits well.</p>

        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
